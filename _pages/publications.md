## [Probing Superconductivity in Two-dimensional Uniform Electron Gas by Precursory Cooper Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03624)

Pengcheng Hou, **Xiansheng Cai**, Tao Wang, Youjin Deng, Nikolay Prokof'ev\*, Boris Svistunov\*, and Kun Chen\*, **ArXiv 2303.03624**(2023)

We investigate the temperature dependence of the linear response of a generic Fermi liquid to a pair-creating perturbation, referred to as precursory Cooper flow. We show that the form of this dependence allows for an unbiased prediction of the BCS transition temperature, Tc, from data collected at temperatures dramatically higher than Tc. We employ this technique to calculate the phase diagram of superconducting states with multiple orbital channels in a moderately interacting two-dimensional uniform electron gas. Our analysis of the leading correction to the pair susceptibility reveals the possibility of predicting the temperature evolution of pairing correlations and Tc in low-temperature superconductors through the analysis of DC I-V characteristics of tunnel junctions at high temperatures.

## [On the Origin of Coulomb Pseudopotential: Two Wrongs Make a "Right"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05238)

Tao Wang, **Xiansheng Cai**, Kun Chen\*, Nikolay Prokof'ev\*, and Boris Svistunov\*,  **ArXiv 2207.05238**(2022) 

We explore the effect of Coulomb repulsion on the phonon-mediated BCS-type Cooper instability in the electron gas using a numeric approach that is controllably accurate at small to moderate values of the Coulomb parameter, rs≲2. We demonstrate the necessity of breaking the net result into two distinctively different effects: the reduction of the Fermi-liquid renormalization factor and the change of the effective low-energy coupling. The latter quantity is shown to behave non-monotonically with an extremum at rs≈0.75. Within the random-phase approximation, Coulomb interaction eventually starts to {\it enhance} the effective pairing coupling at rs>2 and the suppression of the critical temperature is entirely due to the renormalized Fermi-liquid properties. The onset of the enhancement is, however, sensitive to the approximation used for incorporating vertex corrections. Our results call for radical reconsideration of the widely accepted picture that the effect of Coulomb interactions reduces to a (weak) repulsive pseudopotential.

## [Superconductivity in the Uniform Electron Gas: Irrelevance of Kohn-Luttinger Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01320)

**Xiansheng Cai**, Tao Wang, Nikolay Prokof'ev\*,  Boris Svistunov\*, and Kun Chen\*, **Phys. Rev. B 106, L220502**(2022)

We study the Cooper instability in jellium model in the controlled regime of small to intermediate values of the Coulomb parameter rs≤2. We confirm that superconductivity naturally emerges from purely repulsive interactions described by the Kukkonen-Overhauser vertex function. By employing the implicit renormalization approach and the discrete Lehmann representation we reveal that even in the small-rs limit, the dominant mechanism behind Cooper instability is based on dynamic screening of the Coulomb interaction—accurately captured by the random phase approximation, whereas the Kohn-Luttinger contribution is negligibly small and, thus, not relevant.

## [Quantum-to-classical correspondence in two-dimensional Heisenberg models](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.035132)

Tao Wang, **Xiansheng Cai**, Kun Chen, Nikolay Prokof'ev, Boris Svistunov. **Phys. Rev. B 101, 035132**(2020)

The quantum-to-classical correspondence (QCC) in spin models is a puzzling phenomenon where the static susceptibility of a quantum system agrees with its classical-system counterpart, at a different corresponding temperature, within the systematic error at a subpercent level. We employ the bold diagrammatic Monte Carlo method to explore the universality of QCC by considering three different two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg models. In particular, we reveal the existence of QCC in models with two parameters.
